- A cutting-edge NoSQL social network API for building and enhancing social networking applications with scalable, high-performance backend support.

## Description

- My motivation for building this application was the desire to create a powerful and flexible backend solution for social networking applications, enabling developers to build scalable, efficient, and dynamic social platforms.
- This project was built to provide a comprehensive NoSQL-based API that supports various social network functionalities such as user management, thoughts, responses, and connections, making it easier for developers to integrate these features into their applications.
- This solves the problem of developing and scaling social network applications by offering a robust backend infrastructure that handles complex data relationships and high-volume transactions with ease.
- In this project, I learned the importance of optimizing data structures for performance and scalability, the significance of a well-designed API in supporting diverse front-end applications, and the value of using NoSQL databases to manage the dynamic and interconnected data typical of social networks.

## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, Node.js, NPM Express, and NPM Mongoose. From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally on your device you can open VSCode (IDE). Lastly once VSCode is running, open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), type npm install for the node_modules packages, and then run the server using NPM run dev. Once you've done this the server will be deployed for local testing, debugging, and developing.
